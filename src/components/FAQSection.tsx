            answer="My passion for technology started with gaming on PS3 and later on PC, where I became interested in optimizing performance. This led to an internship at Betspawn during middle school, where I had my first encounter with coding."
            answer2="After stepping away from gaming and coding for a while, I rediscovered my interest in my last year of high school through JavaScript courses on Codecademy. A few years later, I decided to take learning seriously, and now Iâ€™m pursuing a Full Stack Web Developer diploma at Medieinstitutetâ€”with much more to come."

              answer="I'm big on planning and setting everything up before diving in to ensure a smooth process throughout the project. Changes will always come up during development, but having a well-structured plan makes it easier to get an initial picture of how the end product should behave and look. I focus on keeping my work structured and minimalistic."
              // answer2="I start by taking initial notes on the intended functionality. Then, I map out the application's flow to identify potential challenges and find the most efficient way to begin."
              answer3="My problem-solving method follows five steps:
                  1. Understanding the problem
                  2. Writing a step-by-step list in plain English
                  3. Turning that list into pseudocode
                  4. Implementing the code
                  5. Testing the final solution
                  This method isn't just for codingâ€”it can be applied to many types of problem-solving. Try it yourself! ðŸ˜Š"

Right now, my focus is on learning as much as possible, finding my style, and refining my skills. I am currently working on expanding my knowledge in backend development to ensure safe data storage for users."
              answer2="I am also looking for an internship this summer and next autumn. I hope to learn a lot during these periods, especially about how the industry works and, of course, the technologies used at companies.
